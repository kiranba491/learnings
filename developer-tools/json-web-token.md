**JSON Web Tokens (JWT) 💻**

Hello Everyone! 💛<br/>
Imagine you're at a party. To get in, you’re given a wristband that proves you’re invited. Once you have it, you don’t need to show your ID every time—you just flash the wristband.

*A JSON Web Token (JWT) works the same way in web applications:<br/>*
1️⃣ You log in and get a token (your wristband).<br/>
2️⃣ This token has all the info the server needs to identify you.<br/>
3️⃣ Every time you make a request, you show the token instead of logging in again.<br/>

*JWTs are:<br/>*
✅ Compact (easy to pass around).<br/>
✅ Secure (if handled right).<br/>
✅ Self-contained (no need to keep checking a database for each request).<br/>

The beauty? It’s all in the signature—the server knows if someone tries to tamper with the token.
